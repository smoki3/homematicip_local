## Easier Setup and Configuration

### New Reauthentication Flow

When your CCU password has changed or credentials have expired, you no longer need to delete and re-add the integration. Home Assistant will display a "Reauthenticate" button that allows you to simply enter the new credentials.

### Quick Reconfiguration

The new "Reconfigure" option in the integration settings allows you to quickly adjust connection settings (host, port, TLS) without repeating the entire setup process. Useful when your CCU moves to a new IP address.

### Improved Error Messages

Configuration steps now show "Step X of Y" so you know how far along the setup has progressed. Error messages have been redesigned with specific hints about what to check - whether the CCU is reachable or if credentials are correct.

---

## CCU Backup from Home Assistant

### Create Backups Without Leaving Home Assistant

You can now create CCU system backups directly from Home Assistant using the new backup service. No need to log into the CCU web interface.

**How to create a backup:**

```yaml
service: homematicip_local.create_backup
data: {}
```

The backup file will be stored on your CCU and can be downloaded from there. This is useful for:
- Regular automated backups via Home Assistant automations
- Creating a backup before making configuration changes
- Disaster recovery preparation

**Example: Weekly backup automation:**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Weekly CCU Backup"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "03:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: time
        weekday:
          - sun
    action:
      - service: homematicip_local.create_backup
```

## Device Pairing Made Easy

### Install Mode Control

Pairing new devices is now easier with dedicated install mode controls directly in Home Assistant. The integration provides separate buttons for each interface:

| Entity | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Activate Install Mode HmIP-RF** | Start pairing mode for HomematicIP devices |
| **Activate Install Mode BidCos-RF** | Start pairing mode for classic Homematic devices |

### Install Mode Duration Sensors

Two sensors show the remaining time while install mode is active:

- **Install Mode HmIP-RF duration**: Countdown for HomematicIP pairing (in seconds)
- **Install Mode BidCos-RF duration**: Countdown for BidCos pairing (in seconds)

When the sensor shows 0, install mode has ended.

**Example: Start pairing and notify when ready:**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Start HmIP Pairing"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: mobile_app_notification_action
        event_data:
          action: START_PAIRING
    action:
      - service: button.press
        target:
          entity_id: button.ccu_activate_install_mode_hmip_rf
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Install mode active for 60 seconds. Pair your device now!"
```

## Adding New Devices from the Inbox

### Delayed Device Creation via Repairs

When you pair a new device with your CCU, it first appears in the CCU's "inbox" waiting to be accepted. Previously, you had to use the CCU web interface to accept these devices. Now Home Assistant handles this for you.

### How It Works

1. **Pair the device** with your CCU (using install mode)
2. **A repair notification** appears in Home Assistant's Settings → System → Repairs
3. **Click the repair** to see the pending device
4. **Enter a name** for the device (or leave empty for the default)
5. **Confirm** to add the device to Home Assistant

### What You'll See

The repair notification shows:
- Device address (e.g., `000A1B2C3D4E5F`)
- Interface (HmIP-RF or BidCos-RF)
- A text field to enter your preferred device name

### Inbox Sensor

A new **Inbox** sensor shows how many devices are waiting in the CCU inbox. This makes it easy to:
- Monitor for newly paired devices
- Create automations that notify you when devices are pending

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Notify on New Inbox Device"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.ccu_inbox
        above: 0
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "New device in CCU inbox - check Repairs to add it"
```

## Siren Control Without Workarounds

### Automatic Select Entities for Tone and Light Pattern

Sirens like HmIP-ASIR now automatically provide two select entities:

- **Siren Tone**: Choose the acoustic alarm tone (rising, falling, alternating, etc.)
- **Siren Light Pattern**: Choose the optical alarm pattern (blinking, alternating, etc.)

These entities can be used directly in automations - no need to manually create InputHelper entities anymore. The selected values are used as defaults when the siren is activated without explicit parameters.

**Example Automation:**

```yaml
- service: select.select_option
  target:
    entity_id: select.living_room_siren_siren_tone
  data:
    option: "Rising frequency"

- service: siren.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id: siren.living_room_siren
```

---

## Dimmers Remember Their Last Brightness

### Restore Last Brightness

Dimmers now save their last brightness setting and automatically restore it when turned on - even after a Home Assistant restart.

**In practice this means:**
- Set dimmer to 40% → turn off → turn on → dimmer is back at 40%
- Works with all dimmers (HmIP-BDT, HmIP-PDT, etc.)
- The setting survives Home Assistant restarts

If you want a different brightness, simply specify it explicitly when turning on.

---

## System Monitoring at a Glance

### New Diagnostic Sensors

Three new sensors show the state of your CCU connection:

| Sensor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **System Health** | Overall connection health (0-100%) |
| **Connection Latency** | CCU response time in milliseconds |
| **Last Event Age** | Seconds since the last received CCU event |

These sensors are great for:
- Monitoring dashboards
- Notifications when connection issues occur
- Long-term analysis of connection quality

---

## New Device Support

### HmIP-WRCD - Wall-Mount Remote Control with Display

The wall-mount remote with display can now show text, icons, and colors:

```yaml
- service: notify.homematicip_local
  data:
    message: "Heating on"
    target: "HmIP-WRCD-000000"
    data:
      icon: "sun"
      color: "orange"
      sound: "long_short"
```

### HmIP-MP3P - Combination Signalling Device

Full support for the combination signalling device with MP3 playback and RGB LED:

- **Play sounds**: `play_sound` service with volume and repeat options
- **Control LED**: `set_sound_led` service with color, brightness, and blink patterns
- **Stop sounds**: `stop_sound` service

---

## Improved Connection Stability

### Automatic Recovery After CCU Restart

The integration now more reliably detects when the CCU has restarted and automatically restores the connection. The recovery process has been improved:

- Staged connection verification
- Automatic retry attempts with backoff
- Fewer error messages in the log during recovery

### Less Log Spam During Connection Issues

Temporary connection problems no longer flood the log with error messages. Instead, a summary is provided when issues occur and when they are resolved.

---

## Easier Schedule Management

### Simplified Schedule Format

Heating schedules can now be read and written in a simpler format, making heating automation more straightforward.

### Faster Schedule Operations

Schedules are cached, making repeated queries much faster.

---

## Minor Improvements

- **Air Quality Sensors**: New entities for DIRT_LEVEL and SMOKE_LEVEL
- **Translations**: Improved translations for entities and error messages

---

## Bug Fixes

- Service `set_schedule_simple_weekday` works correctly again
- Covers and dimmers no longer remain "unavailable" after CCU restart
- RGBW lights no longer turn off unexpectedly during transitions
- Firmware updates are correctly refreshed after checking

---

## Call for Testers: Async XML-RPC Server (Experimental)

We have developed a new **asyncio-native XML-RPC server** as an alternative to the current thread-based implementation. This experimental feature may improve performance and resource usage, especially on systems with many devices.

### What's Different?

The new async server:
- Runs entirely within the asyncio event loop (no extra threads)
- Supports batched CCU events via `system.multicall`
- Includes a health-check endpoint for monitoring
- Provides detailed metrics (request count, latency, errors)

### How to Enable It

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Homematic(IP) Local**
2. Click **Configure** on your integration
3. Select **Debug and Analysis Settings**
4. Enable **Use async XML-RPC server**
5. Click **Submit**
6. Restart Home Assistant for the change to take effect

### What to Watch For

When testing, please pay attention to:

1. **Event Reception**: Do all device state changes arrive in Home Assistant?
2. **Latency**: Does the system feel responsive?
3. **Stability**: Any crashes or connection drops?
4. **Resource Usage**: CPU/memory compared to the default server
5. **Log Messages**: Any errors or warnings related to the RPC server?

### How to Report Issues

If you encounter any problems or have feedback, please:

1. Open an issue at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sukramj/aiohomematic/issues)
2. Include:
   - Your Home Assistant version
   - Number of Homematic devices
   - CCU type (CCU3, RaspberryMatic, etc.)
   - Relevant log entries (set `aiohomematic` logger to `debug` if needed)
   - Description of the issue

Even if everything works perfectly, we'd love to hear about your experience!

### How to Disable It

If you encounter issues, go back to **Debug and Analysis Settings** in the integration configuration, disable the option, and restart Home Assistant to return to the default thread-based server.
