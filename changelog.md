# Version [2.1.2](https://github.com/SukramJ/homematicip_local/compare/2.1.1...2.1.2) (2026-01-10)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix Translation Error on Duplicate CCU Configuration**: Fixed "The intl string context variable 'serial' was not provided" error when attempting to add a CCU instance that is already configured. The abort message now correctly displays the serial number.

# Version [2.1.1](https://github.com/SukramJ/homematicip_local/compare/2.1.0...2.1.1) (2026-01-09)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix Unwanted Config Entry Reloads**: Fixed integration restarting whenever a device's availability changed. The device registry's `disabled_by` field was being updated on availability changes, which Home Assistant interprets as requiring a config entry reload. Entity availability is now handled exclusively through the entity's `available` property, which is the correct approach for transient state changes.
- **Fix False Positive Duplicate Key Warnings**: Entity description validation no longer warns about rules with the same key when they have different filtering criteria (device filters, priorities, etc.). These are valid override patterns, not duplicates.

## Bump aiohomematic to [2026.1.27](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/compare/2026.1.20...2026.1.27)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix State Machine Transition Error on Unload**: Allow transition from `FAILED` to `DISCONNECTED` state. This fixes `InvalidStateTransitionError` when unloading the integration while a client is in failed state
- **Fix Leaked EventBus Subscriptions on Central Stop**: Six internal subscription leaks have been fixed across `HubCoordinator`, `ClientCoordinator`, `CacheCoordinator`, `EventCoordinator`, `CentralUnit`, and various client classes. The number of leaked subscriptions logged at shutdown has been reduced from ~7800 to zero
- **Fix Empty Device List Treated as Error**: The `initialize_proxy()` method now correctly handles empty device lists from interfaces that don't support RPC callbacks. Previously, an empty device list was incorrectly treated as a connection failure
- **Fix Ping/Pong Mismatch Issue Not Clearing**: The `ping_pong_mismatch` repair issue is now correctly removed when the connection recovers (mismatch_count drops to 0). Previously, the issue remained visible even after recovery due to a type comparison mismatch
- **Clear Stale Issues on Startup**: Transient repair issues (`ping_pong_mismatch`, `pending_pong_mismatch`, `unknown_pong_mismatch`, `fetch_data_failed`, `interface_not_reachable`, `xmlrpc_server_receives_no_events`) are now automatically deleted when the integration starts. These issues from previous sessions are no longer relevant after a restart
- **Fix Persistent Repair Issues After CCU Restart** ([#2757](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/2757)): Fixed central state getting stuck in "recovering" after successful recovery. A race condition in `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator` caused the state transition check to run before the interface was removed from active recoveries, preventing the transition to "running" state. Also adds immediate connection repair notifications when recovery starts and clears them when recovery succeeds
- **Fix Recovery Stuck in Infinite Retry Loop**: After CCU restart, the XML-RPC proxy's HTTP connection could enter an inconsistent state causing `system.listMethods` calls to fail silently. The proxy transport is now reset before RPC availability checks during recovery

### Internal

- **Migrate to Strongly Typed Events**: Updated to use `IntegrationIssueType` and `IntegrationIssueSeverity` enums instead of string comparisons for better type safety and IDE support

# Version [2.1.0](https://github.com/SukramJ/homematicip_local/compare/2.0.6...2.1.0) (2026-01-08)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Home Assistant 2026.1.0+ Compatibility**: Fixed "Detected blocking call to import_module" error that prevented the integration from loading. All blocking I/O operations during central unit creation now run in a thread pool executor.

### Internal

- **Async Central Creation**: Migrated `ControlConfig.create_central()`, `check_config()`, `create_control_unit()`, and `create_control_unit_temp()` to async methods
- **Factory Pattern for ControlUnit**: Added `BaseControlUnit.async_create()` class method for async instantiation

## Bump aiohomematic to [2026.1.20](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/compare/2026.1.17...2026.1.20)

### New Features

- **`old_value` and `new_value` fields in `DataPointStateChangedEvent`**: External consumers can now track what changed without maintaining their own previous state
- **`AvailabilityInfo` dataclass**: New unified view of device availability bundling reachability, battery, and signal information
- **`Device.availability` property**: Returns `AvailabilityInfo` providing a unified view of device connectivity and health status
- **Consumer API documentation**: New `docs/consumer_api.md` guide for external consumers like Matter bridges

### Internal

- **Eliminate all remaining lazy imports**: All `noqa: PLC0415` markers have been removed from production code. Circular imports have been resolved through module restructuring
- **Remove unnecessary delayed imports**: Moved imports to top-level where no circular dependency exists

# Version [2.0.6](https://github.com/SukramJ/homematicip_local/compare/2.0.5...2.0.6) (2026-01-08)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Device Auto-Confirmation After Cache Clear**: Fixed devices not being auto-confirmed after clearing the aiohomematic cache. Previously, all devices were incorrectly shown as repair issues because the wrong device identifier format was used for registry lookups. Devices that already exist in Home Assistant are now correctly recognized and auto-confirmed
- **Device Availability Updates**: Fixed device availability changes not updating the device registry correctly due to the same identifier format mismatch

## Bump aiohomematic to [2026.1.17](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/compare/2026.1.13...2026.1.17)

### Bug Fixes

- **VirtualDevices Init Timeout**: Fixed VirtualDevices init() timing out even though the CCU successfully processed the request. On some CCU backends (OpenCCU, RaspberryMatic), the VirtualDevices service processes the init() request correctly but fails to send the response. The initialization is now treated as successful if a listDevices callback was received during the timeout
- **VirtualDevices Connection Failure**: Fixed VirtualDevices failing to connect on OpenCCU/RaspberryMatic. The CCU's XML-RPC parser crashed when receiving device descriptions with empty `CHILDREN` fields. Device descriptions are now normalized to ensure `CHILDREN` is always a list
- **Retry Mechanism Removed**: Removed the retry mechanism that was conflicting with CircuitBreaker pattern, causing cascading failures. This particularly affected slower backends (Virtual Devices on Raspberry Pi 4, OpenCCU systems) where retry attempts counted toward circuit breaker thresholds, triggering premature failures during initialization. Network errors now fail immediately for more predictable behavior
- **Homegear Device Names Not Loading**: Fixed device names not loading for Homegear backends. The InterfaceClient was missing metadata retrieval via `getMetadata()` calls

# Version [2.0.5](https://github.com/SukramJ/homematicip_local/compare/2.0.4...2.0.5) (2026-01-05)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **Simple Schedule Services**: Added `get_schedule_simple_profile` and `get_schedule_simple_weekday` services. These return schedule data in a simplified format that is easier to read and use.

### Deprecations

- **Schedule Services**: Deprecated `set_schedule_profile`, `set_schedule_weekday`, `get_schedule_profile`, and `get_schedule_weekday` services. These will be removed in April 2026. Use `set_schedule_simple_profile`, `set_schedule_simple_weekday`, `get_schedule_simple_profile`, and `get_schedule_simple_weekday` instead. A warning is now logged when using the deprecated services.

## Bump aiohomematic to [2026.1.13](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/compare/2026.1.9...2026.1.13)

### Bug Fixes

- **CUxD/CCU-Jack Recovery Fix**: Fixed recovery mechanism for JSON-RPC-only interfaces (CUxD, CCU-Jack). Recovery now checks the JSON-RPC port (80/443) instead of failing at the TCP check stage. This prevents the central unit from entering a FAILED state when these services are actually available
- **Device Availability Not Updating**: Fixed devices not showing as unavailable when UN_REACH changes. All entity states are now refreshed when device availability changes
- **HmIP-MP3P LED Auto-Off**: Fixed LED turning off after 10 seconds on HmIP-MP3P sound player devices
- **VirtualDevices Init Timeout**: Fixed initialization timeout causing client failure for virtual devices
- **Device Cache After Firmware Updates**: Fixed device structure changes after firmware updates. Cached descriptions are now removed and refreshed from the CCU, preventing errors like "Non-existent Channel 3"
- **Device Replacement/Re-pairing**: Fixed device replacement and re-pairing handlers. Old device entries are now properly removed and recreated with fresh data
- **Hub Entities with Secondary Client Failures**: Fixed system variables and programs not appearing when secondary clients (e.g., CUxD) fail to initialize
- **Connection Recovery Port Detection**: Fixed port detection during connection recovery for all client implementations
- **Channel Names Not Loading**: Fixed channel names not loading when using InterfaceClient (JSON-RPC). The nested channels array from the JSON-RPC response is now processed correctly

# Version [2.0.4](https://github.com/SukramJ/homematicip_local/compare/2.0.3...2.0.4) (2026-01-04)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **Undetected Interface Warning**: Config flow now shows a warning when enabled interfaces were not detected on the CCU (e.g., CUxD installed but not running)

### Bug Fixes

- **Device Trigger Address Mapping**: Fixed `device_address` to `address` conversion in device triggers. Existing automations using device triggers (e.g., button press events) that failed with "required key not provided @ data['address']" will now work after re-saving
- **Validation Error UX**: Validation errors during interface configuration now stay on the interface page instead of navigating to port configuration. This allows users to disable problematic interfaces (e.g., CUxD not running) directly
- **Interface Availability Pre-Check**: Config flow now validates interface availability BEFORE attempting connection. If an interface is enabled but was not detected on the CCU, a clear error message is shown immediately without unnecessary connection attempts

## Bump aiohomematic to [2026.1.9](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/compare/2026.1.8...2026.1.9)

### Improvements

- **Backend Detection Validates Interface Availability**: The backend detection now verifies that each interface process is actually running via `is_present()` check, not just installed
- **Fix CUxD/CCU-Jack JSON-RPC Method Overrides**: `ClientJsonCCU` now properly uses JSON-RPC for all device operations
- 
# Version [2.0.3](https://github.com/SukramJ/homematicip_local/compare/2.0.2...2.0.3) (2026-01-03)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **Light Last Brightness Option**: Added config option `Restore last brightness for lights` in advanced settings. When enabled, lights will turn on with the last non-zero brightness level instead of default 100%. Default is disabled.

### Improvements

- **Configuration Options**: Improved labels and descriptions for all advanced configuration options in config flow and options flow
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md with corrected descriptions for Device Behavior and Expert Options sections

### Bug Fixes

- **Sensor State Class**: Added unit-based fallback rules for %, bar, °C, and g/m³ units. This restores long-term statistics support for Homebrew devices like HB-UNI sensors
- **Device Model Matching**: Fixed case-insensitive device model matching for entity description rules. Older devices like HmIP-SWDO (reported as `HMIP-SWDO` by CCU) now correctly receive their device_class (e.g., `window`)
- **Service Schema**: Removed invalid `base_temperature` parameter from `set_schedule_simple_profile` service schema (parameter is part of `simple_profile_data`, not a separate field)
- **Service Name**: Fixed incorrect service name `create_backup` → `create_ccu_backup` in release notes

## Bump aiohomematic to [2026.1.8](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/compare/2026.1.5...2026.1.8)

# Version 1.30.2 (2023-02-08)

### All changes:

- Remove `native_precision` for Concentration of HmIP-SCTH230

This change is necessary because `native_precision` has been swapped for `suggested_display_precision` without a deprecation period in the HA core. Before switching to HA 2023.3, **all** CC users who use version 1.28.0 (or greater) must therefore update.
Rounding support for Concentration of HmIP-SCTH230 will be re-added with HA 2023.3

# Version 1.29.0 (2023-02-06)

### New features

- Add virtual channels for HmIP cover/blind

### All changes:

- Bump hahomematic to 2023.2.5
  - Add comments to parameter_visibility
  - Use `put_paramset` only when there is more than one parameter to sent
  - Use only one implementation for garage doors (HO/TM)
  - Avoid backend calls if value/state doesn't change
    - If an entity (e.g. `switch`) has only **one** parameter that represents its state, then a call to the backend will be made,
      if the parameter value sent is not identical to the current state.
    - If an entity (e.g. `cover`, `climate`, `light`) has **multiple** parameters that represent its state, then a call to the backend will be made,
      if one of these parameter values sent is not identical to its current state.
    - Not covered by this approach:
      - platforms: lock and siren.
      - services: `stop_cover`, `stop_cover_tilt`, `enable_away_mode_*`, `disable_away_mode`, `set_on_time_value`
      - system variables
  - Add virtual channels for HmIP cover/blind:
    - Channel no as examples from HmIP-BROLL. The implementation of the first actor channel (4) remains unchanged, which means that this channel (4) shows the correct cover position from sensor channel (3).
      The other actor channels (5+6) are generated as initially deactivated and only use the cover position from their own channel after activation.
- Fix channel 0 not working for put_paramset

- Rename climate presets from 'Profile _' to 'week*program*_':
  HA now allows translations of custom preset modes. The internal preset mode has been renamed from 'Profile _' to 'week*program*_'.
  If service climate.set_preset_mode was used with values like "Proflle 1", these automations and scripts need to be edited and use "week_program_1" instead.
  This preset mode is now displayed as "WP 1" to better accommodate the available space in the UI.

  See [Readme](https://github.com/sukramj/homematicip_local#noteworthy-about-entity-states) for further information.
- Add attribute state_uncertain
  There is now an extra attribute at each entity, that shows is the state of the entity might be uncertain due to a CCU restart.
  This should be relevant, if the CCU has been restarted and HA is still running.
